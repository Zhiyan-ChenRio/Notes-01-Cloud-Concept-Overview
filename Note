1.3	Hardware V.S Software
•	Hardware: Physical components including CPU, RAM, hard drives, as well as external peripherals like keyboards and printers
•	Software: Digital data, application code, and programs, such as operating systems or document editors, are not physically touchable
•	Hardware Clouding: Cloud environment mirrors physical hardware with virtual CPU, RAM, and Hard Drives running on shared specialized hardware
•	Software Clouding: Software operates in the cloud as on physical hardware, but on virtual hardware


 
1.4	The Four Pillars of an IT Framework
•	Infrastructure: This involves both hardware and software, providing services and support to meet user requirements in these IT components.
•	Development: This encompasses the entire process of creating and structuring software applications.
•	Security: It's focused on ensuring data security, safeguarding critical information, and protecting against unauthorized access and viruses.
•	Data: Refers to all information processed or stored by a computer, which can be saved locally or in cloud-based storage


 
1.5	 & 1.6 &1.7 Common Terminology in IT: Introduction 
•	 Be familiar with desktop component and job roles in IT:
o	Components:
	Motherboard
	Central Processing Unit = CPU
	Random Access Memory = RAM
	Hard Drive

 
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 & 1.14 Terminology: 
•	Motherboard: main circuit board of the computer ( ask main board or system board)
•	Firmware / BIOS: Basic Input/Output System; is a program pre-installed in windows-based computer 
•	CPU: primary component of a computer that processes instructions. 
•	RAM: Random Access Memory; amount of memory 
•	Storage: where you keep files for your operating system, applications and documents. 
o	Hard Disk Drive (HDD): hard drive or HDD that is non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer
o	Solid State Drive (SSD): a storage medium that use non-volatile memory as a means of holding and accessing data. 
•	Expansion Cards / CPU: Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or graphic card; is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard to add additional functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. 
•	Misc: 
o	Case: a case to encloses most of the components of the system 
o	Cooling Fan: consider as hardware device by circulating air from the computer
o	Heat Sink: a device that incorporates either a fan or some other means to keep a hot component. 
o	Liquid Cooling: to reduce temperature of its hardware
o	Power Supply: convert alternating current electric power to low-voltage direct current power for the interna components of the computer
o	Input/Output devices: 
	Input: allow user to enter data into a system or control its operation
	Output: speaker, monitors….
